![image](gradioposter.png)

Welcome to the "Embedding a Machine Learning Model in Gradio" repository! This project demonstrates how to integrate a trained machine learning model into a user-friendly interface using Gradio, a Python library for creating customizable UI components.

Using Gradio to deploy a classification model for customer churn in a Telco.
One of the best ways to share your machine learning model, API, or data science workflow with others is to create an interactive app that allows your users or colleagues to try out the demo in their browsers.

### **Installation**
Clone the repository:

Replace model.pkl with your own trained machine learning model file.

Modify the predict function in app.py to utilize your model for making predictions. Feel free to customize the input and output types based on your model's requirements.

Customize the UI components in app.py using Gradio's intuitive API. You can adjust the layout, appearance, and interaction of the interface to suit your needs.

Start the Gradio server

Gradio allows you to build demos and share them, all in Python.
This project is a continuation of the customer churn analysis of a telecommunications company here https://github.com/flokabukie/Classification-Machine-Learning-

Hope this helps in your own machine learning Gradio project. Feel free to explore, experiment, and enhance the code according to your requirements. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
